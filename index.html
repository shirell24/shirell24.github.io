  <h1>Vector Illustration: Bieb Malti</h1>

  <p>
    Hello there! I am Shirley Ellul, a first-year BFA student currently studying 
    Digital Art at the University of Malta, and welcome to my website.
  </p>
      
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    This is one of my favourite topics and artworks that I have covered and created so far. 
    It is a vector illustration done on Adobe Illustrator, a graphic design software.
  </p>
    
  <h3>The Artwork</h3>
  <p>
    Inspired by 
    <a href="https://www.tefittazza.com" target="_blank">Te' fit-tazza</a> and 
    <a href="https://studiomaltatype.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Maltatype</a>, 
    this artwork is meant to capture a simple yet iconic part of Maltese architecture, 
    found in many older towns and cities. The process started off with a simple sketch 
    of the door and composition, in order to simplify and better visualise the final work. 
    After that, I started building the final work using basic shapes and colours, 
    slowly adding depth and detail.
