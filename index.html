<h1>Vector Illustration: Bieb Malti</h1>
  
Hello there! I am Shirely Ellul, a first year BFA student currently studying 
  Digital Art at the University of Malta, and welcome to my website.
    
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
This is one of my favourite topics and artworks that i have covered and created so far. 
 It is a vector illustration done on Adobe Illustrator, a graphic design software.
  
<h3>The Artwork:</h3>
Inspired by _ Te' fit-tazza _ and Maltatype _, this artwork is meant to capture a 
  simple yet iconic part of Maltese architecture, found in many older towns and cities. 
  The process started off with a simple sketch of the door and composition, in order to 
  simplify and better visualise the final work. After, that I started building the
  final work using basuc shapes and colours, slowly adding depth and detail
  
Images:
On the left is an image of the original door which the illustration is based off.
On the right side is the primary sketch.
